# Google Homepage
Replicating the Google Home page using HTML & CSS.

Some of the skills I learned include:
* Using **HTML5 tags** to simplify code and improve accessibility
* **Attributing** external resources
* Using a **CSS reset** to remove default styling
* Using **Flexbox** to simplify layout
* Target nested elements with and without IDs / classes
